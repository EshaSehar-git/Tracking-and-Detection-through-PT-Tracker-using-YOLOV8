# Tracking-and-Detection-through-PT-Tracker-using-YOLOV8
This project combines the capabilities of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) for object detection with PT (Point Tracker) tracking algorithms to achieve real-time detection and tracking of objects in video streams. The objective is to maintain the consistency of bounding boxes and ensure accurate tracking of detected objects as they move across frames.
## PT Tracker
PT Tracker (Point Tracker) is a type of tracking algorithm that focuses on maintaining the position of objects across video frames using key points. Unlike traditional tracking methods that rely on bounding boxes, point trackers track specific feature points within an object, providing a more granular approach to tracking.
## YOLOV8
YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a state-of-the-art model known for its high-speed and accurate object detection capabilities.
It provides real-time detection of multiple objects within images or video frames, outputting bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores for each detected object.
